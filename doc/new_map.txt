New in-game map/tracker
***********************

Objectives
**********

Auto-track area connections and door colors in game. Have better item
tracking than vanilla map.

Area rando :
------------
- see portals on map once they have been traversed
  - use sprites? allow for pixel placement, also solves the boss
    portal potential problems, uses different part of VRAM
  - reuse vanilla map icon system (discard debug stuff), that way
    portal data is naturally separate from 
- distinguish on map where the portals go
  - use colors? or different sprites per area?
  - use text that displays when cursor is on the portal?
  - maybe a bit of both, sprites with small text?
- remove false information displayed, mainly elevator connections text
  - those are sprites (map icons)
- switch in-game area maps
  - bonus: selecting a portal loads the right map, at portal connection
           point
  - this bonus would greatly help distinguishing portals
- in a given "vanilla area" map, see which parts are from which "graph
area", using different colors :
  - that means "explored" tiles should have different colors,
    independent from loaded vanilla area, which means have
    different palettes load when displaying a given area
  - max graph area colors in a given vanilla area: 4 (Brinstar)
- ideally, have in-game area reflect VARIA areas, but that seems
  impossible, as even Subversion elected to have sub-areas inside main
  areas

Door color rando :
------------------
- see locked doors colors once the map tile is explored
  - use sprites/map icons? seems to be the only way, otherwise needs
    way too much map tiles for all combinations
- disiguish each door type
  - 8 colors? 3 ammo + gray door + 4 beams (don't display blue doors)
- make door disappear when open

General item tracking :
-----------------------
- have circle/dots for major/minor items


How
***

Use map overhaul patch as a base.

Useful features:
- area map switching
- more colors usable
- better minimap with more tiles (not more colors though)
- item tracking with circle/dots
  - probably needs to be changed as it ought to be tied to the
    location ID
  - circle = item split loc? or just major upgrade in all splits?
- overall easier customization than vanilla
- map decorations? might be useful to display a legend, but not sure

Limitations :
- only has 4 global colors for "explored tiles", need to make this
  depend on loaded area map
  - bonus: adapt the glowing system as well
- nothing special for map icons, hope that the vanilla system is
  powerful enough

VARIA compatibility :
- rework equipment_screen patch
  - put back vanilla "TIME", ":", "%"
  - find room for "ITEMS"
- rework objectives screen
  - find room for "OBJ"
- general compatibility with these two patches, especially objectives
- manage free space collisions
  - remove hex map to make lots of room
- apply map_graphics.ips in base patches as well

Plan
****

1)

Recompile "Map Overhaul example" with our build system and check the
result on a vanilla ROM.
=> make necessary adjustments, if any

2)

Adapt this example to make a base usable for VARIA without area/door
rando, by making space and restore some vanilla-like behavior :
      - remove hex map
      - remove decoration tiles
      - remove parts of the map showing when unexplored
      - address VARIA compatibility issues above
      - generate "itembit tile change list" from the rando
=> a base patch integrated in the VARIA source tree

3)

Adapt palettes/glow system to have different colors for all 11 graph
areas. If not possible, find the best possible compromise.
      - change the 4 palettes loaded by vanilla area
      - have glowing variants
=> base patch updated

4)

Area/boss rando. Add sprites to the existing map icons system. This
shall be a *separate patch*, to apply only if area/boss rando. The
base patch might have to be changed to accomodate, and tested
separately after modifications.
     - comprehend vanilla map icon system
     - replace some debug map icon stuff?
       - entry points problem solved
       - destination format for portals will vary from simple map
         icons
       - area/boss portals should go through the same system
     - draw portal sprites/palettes
       - figure out spritemap system
       - figure out usable palettes by sprites
       - find the best compromise for used sprites/used palettes wrt
         VRAM space and palettes management
     - replace elevator destination spritemap system with area/boss
       portals?
        - at the very least remove it and use its freespace with the
          portal system
     - add a map switch feature by pressing A when on a portal
        - load the relevant vanilla area if necessary
        - move cursor to destination portal
        - make a sound?

5)

Door colors rando. Add sprites to existing map icons system. This
shall be a *separate patch*, to apply only if door color rando, while
maintaining compatibility if area/boss rando patch is applied as well.
The base patch might have to be changed to accomodate, and tested
separately after modifications.
     - replace some debug map icon stuff?
       - entry points problem solved
       - destination format for doors will vary from simple map
         icons
     - draw portal sprites/palettes
       - figure out usable palettes by sprites
       - find the best compromise for used sprites/used palettes wrt
         VRAM space and palettes management
     - when pressing A on a door, do something to indicate door lock
       - display text somehow?
       - make a sound?
