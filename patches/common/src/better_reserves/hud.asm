;;; Full Reserve Tank HUD Indicator By NoDever2 (https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=418)

;This code adds a new feature to the game where when reserve tanks are full on auto mode, the HUD icon
;turns pink (or more accurately, to the same color as full etanks).

;Warning, the Auto Reserve and Empty Auto Reserve tilemaps at $80998B are now unused and replaced with some custom code.
;The Empty Auto Reserve one has also been repointed (See "Data").

;Thanks to PJBoy's bank logs as always. Also tilemap format is as follows:
;tilemap format is yxpPPPtttttttttt
;where PPP are the palette bits

;;; VARIA edits: we can't use pink because of minimap palette modifications,
;;; add specific tiles and use modified palette 7 (also used for new etank tile)

; First things first, check if reserves are Full, Empty, or neither.
; The way this works is that we are storing a value in $14 with palette bits set that will later be XOR'ed with the reserve tilemap
; tiles loaded from ROM. We are doing this to manipulate the tiles' palette bits on load.
